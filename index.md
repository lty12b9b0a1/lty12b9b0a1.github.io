Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D. candidate student in SoC at the National University of Singapore co-advised by Prof. [Umang Mathur] and Prof. [Prateek Saxena]. Before coming to NUS, I worked with Prof. [Jinsong Han] at Zhejiang University from 2021/10 to 2022/6 and worked remotely with Prof. [Tianhao Wang] from 2022/6 to 2023/6 at the University of Virginia. I received my B.E. in Software Engineering at Zhejiang University in 2023/6.
